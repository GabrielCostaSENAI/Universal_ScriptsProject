# Universal_ScriptsProject
A variation of basic scripts applied such as character movement, rotation, camera movement, etc.

The idea, in general, is to make the basic prototype faster as possible and create more variables as possible for the application, like different rotations of player and camera, interactable objects, modular dialogues, inventory system, etc.

****Important to always try to use good practices, and as a new programmer I am what is written here can always be changed.
I hope that we can always increase the repertoire and that it will help many people in their initial project phases.
